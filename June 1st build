Three, massive, fat and oddly attractive female aliens look down on you. Each on is at least a foot taller than you and must weight at least 800 pounds each. 

Your vision is blurry but you can make a [[green one|Look at the Green One]], a [[purple one|Look at the Purple one]], and an [[orange one|Look at the Orange one.]]

She has a fleshy beak, a ridged forehead and two sets of eyes; one sitting above the other and a pair of glasses for the lower ones. 

She seems to have a no-nonsense attitude about her as she taps away at some sort of tablet with her large, three fingered hands. 

She is also wearing some sort of lab coat like robe, although it looks like she could never close it over her figure. 

And even though she is standing straight on, you can tell she has the [[biggest butt|big butt]] of the three aliens as it sticks out from her sides.

She has one large round eye, with a slit pupil purple and aqua blue iris which pops against her deep magenta skin. She has one fin one the ridge of her head and scales all over her body. 

You also notice that she has the largest belly of the three aliens. In fact it&#39;s hard to see if she even has legs or not. Her belly bounces and sways as she gets closer too you, her long meaty tail whipping behind her. 

She defiantly has arms. Oddly Muscular ones. A peculiar compilation of definition and jiggly fat, ending in four longfingered claws. 

However the next thing you notice is her large mouth, rimmed by some rather sultry, plump lips. But you immediately taken back as she breaks into a sinister grin and [[reveals rows of sharp teeth.|Scream]]

You could even mistake it for a tree at a distance if it weren&#39;t for all the excitable fidgeting it was doing. 

In place of hair she had a large patch of leaves that created something similar to a messy bob. It covered most of their upper face, where her forehead and eyes would be...if she indeed had any. 

It&#39;s mouth, or approximation of such was made of a series of vertical slits that formed and almost permanent smile. Her arms were made out of vines which playfully swung side to side. 

Her skin resembled that of a fleshy smooth cucumber. Much more malleable, as you could tell from her large swaying chest. It was clearly the biggest of the three, and spilled over her still full figure.       

You could hear that they were trying to stifle a laughing fit, as you could just make out chirps and giggles. 

They finally broke down and  said “Hi” in a higher pitch voice. 

But as they brought their vines down from the wave, they hit a near by try of instruments. Nothing fell but it did make a loud clatter that caused the other to look her way. Her only response was a [[sheepish grin|Chuckle]].

The Purple one chuckled a bit, almost sounding like a pur. &quot;I got a good feeling about this one.&quot; she said menancingly.

Talosa coyly waddles back but keeps her eye fixed on you.

The orange alien soon waddles into the room and you swear her round back side nearly grazes the the sides of the door as she enters.

&lt;p&gt;“This all...doesn&#39;t look quite right.”, you say as you point to the food. 

&lt;p&gt;“True it is...an approximation. But I can assure you it is safe and delicious. Eat. Now.” She said in a sterner tone.

With hesitation you place one two fingers on it at first, feeling how soft it is. Then you place your whole palm on it and feel a kind of comfortable coolness, like the other side of a pillow. She moans a little as the warmth from your hand transfers to her body. You can tell she is enjoying the sensation. 

Almost instinctively, you place your other hand on her belly and now you slightly kneading it. She let&#39;s out a louder moan. 

But before things can get any further, you hear over a speaker. “Um hmm!” You recognize it as the orange alien. 

“Talosa, you were sent to see if you could persuade the subject to participate in the experiment. If we could move things along.”

Talosa, looks at you. “Feels nice right? So why don&#39;t you grow your own and we can have twice the fun.” she says through a low murmur.

&quot;You&#39;re a terrible lair.&quot; She declares in a gutteral pur. &quot;You want to touch it. And I WANT you to touch it. So go ahead.&quot;

She gets a little closer and [[offers you a feel once more.|&quot;Yeah I do&quot;]]

“Fair enough...”, she admitted. “...but I&#39;m the muscle on the ship. I&#39;m here to make sure you stay in line.  Which mean your going to be seeing a lot of me. And I better be seeing a lot of you soon.” she finisher in almost a gravely hyena laugh. 

“Now, are you going to play nice?”

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly clamps pop out of the chair, securing your wrists and ankles. You try to thrash yourself loose but soon pads appears on the sides of your torso and head, restricting your movements even further. 
&lt;p&gt;Then mechanic arms pop down from the ceiling and start grabing at the food and bring it up to you lips.

You look at the food once again and still can&#39;t get over how eerie the spread looks. Then you look back  at the pleading plant girl who seems genuinely upset that she displeased you. She continues to fidget and hop in place as she waits for your answer.

&lt;p&gt;You take a moment to console the green alien and commended her efforts. 

&lt;p&gt;“Really. Thanks.” She says as she sniffles a little. “I did do my best. Talosa and Gorga said that if I did a good job then we might be able to spend time together.&quot;  

&lt;p&gt;&quot;What does that mean?&quot; you ask her. 

&lt;p&gt;“You know if you get fat enough we can (if:$number is 2)[let humans into the federation.&quot;](if:$number is 1)[use you to make more babies.&quot;](if: $number is 3)[make you our new king.&quot;]}

&quot;Ah...A...OF ALL THE...&quot; she stammers. She looks you over for a few moments and regains her composure.

&quot;... Fine...&quot; she says in a sharp but cold tone. &quot;If it will get you to cooperate.&quot;

She then pivotes in place, shifting her weight back and forth until her large round buttocks are pointed towards you.

You slowly place your hand on the large mound of flesh and are surprise by the warmth and how tone it is. There was was more fat than muscle but still.

As you you start to knead her backside a bit, you can hear her say.&quot;Oh&quot; in a pleasently surprised tone.  Then she quickly clears her throat, move forward, leaving you hand in the air and  start to turn around.

&quot;There. You&#39;ve had your fun. No will you proceed?&quot;

“OH!” she says in suddenly realization. “My tubers. Yeah, sure, they are fun to touch. But not to hard. They might bust and I got start over again.” She says as she waddles over and leans close to you. 

After a moment you gently cup underneath her chest and feel the heft as they slosh in your palms. The green alien starts to giggle as he feels you touch. She starts to move closer and starts caressing you arms with her vines when suddenly a voice interrupts over an intercom. 

“Laat, is this act totally necessary to getting the subject to comply?” You recognize the sound of the orange alien.

“What...wah...um...is it?”, the green alien asks you in a ditsy manner, clearly still distracted from your touch.
